  <h1>Graduation thesis: Building the Design System AI Chatbot</h1>

  <h5>Published: 14.08.2025</h5>

  <em>Using a Research-through-Design approach, the study involved interviews, chatbot development, and user testing to evaluate human-chatbot interaction in a professional setting. Key outcomes include communication guidelines for effective workplace chatbots, user insights on trust and utility, and a structured design process for future chatbot assistant integration.</em>

## Solution

As AI becomes more prevalent in modern workplaces, there is limited understanding of how chatbots should interact with employees to be trusted, helpful, and usable—especially as virtual design system assistants.

In this project, I developed a GPT-3.5 Turbo-powered chatbot to assist with design system guidance in a Finnish software organisation. The project focused on identifying ideal interaction styles and key factors influencing trust and usefulness in chatbot-based workplace collaboration.

### Outcome

- **A chatbot integrated with GPT-3.5 Turbo using Voiceflow**
- **Communication guidelines** for effective workplace chatbots
- **User insights** on trust, utility, and preferred interaction styles
- **A structured design process** for future chatbot assistant integration

### Research Questions

**RQ1:** What interaction styles do employees prefer from chatbots as virtual assistants in the workplace?  
**RQ2:** What factors affect individuals’ trust in using AI chatbots in the workplace?  
**RQ3:** How do employees perceive the usefulness of AI chatbots in the workplace?

## Chatbot Prototype

The development platform used is Voiceflow. This choice is based on the previous study of Liu (2023), which compared 14 potential chatbot development tools to make the choice of the most suitable one for designing and developing the chatbot.
