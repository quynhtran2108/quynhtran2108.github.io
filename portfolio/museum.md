# Preserving personal conversation in friendly and accessible way for the museum

**Challenge:**  
Finding a user-friendly & accessible way to collect representative data about personal communication and media history for the new museum. The goal was to ensure the collected data represents the population of Finland as a whole, without any biases.

## Summary
Our team tackled the challenge of creating a user-friendly, accessible, and bias-free way to collect representative data about Finland’s personal communication and media history for Vapriikki Museo. The main hurdle was balancing the museum’s need for authentic communication records with users’ privacy concerns.

Through surveys in English and Finnish, we gathered insights from **30 respondents: 70% were willing to donate data, 60% trusted the museum, and 97% preferred a censoring feature.** 

Based on these findings, we designed “Fånmin”, a prototype app where users can securely store, personalise, and share memorable conversations. Features included Polaroid-style framing, tagging, a timeline view, and a VR gallery simulating a museum exhibition.

As team leader, I facilitated idea generation, coordinated stakeholder meetings, created the design system and prototype, and contributed to our final presentation. The project emphasised the importance of teamwork, time management, and creating solutions that are not just creative but also feasible.

## Then, what's next...
We are happy that the Vapriikki Museo  continue want us to develop further the product concept “Fånmin”, an app for securing personal digital communication to the collections of museums. However, the museum, itself at this moment, cannot receive the grant from the Finnish Heritage Agency. Therefore the project was delayed.
