## Problem

The toolset workflow was complicated, making it hard for users to work effectively. Users often got stuck and didn’t complete all steps to see results.

## Research
### Exploiting the user data based on the key metrics

To have a better understanding of user interaction with the current dashboard, I worked closely with the Marketing team to exploit the data (using Holistic & dataStudio) and examine how users were interacting with the tool step-by-step.
Following that, I implemented the HEART framework for analysing each feature that we had on the current website & looked at the overall product metrics based on: adoption, task success & engagement.

<img src="/assets/writerzen-heartframework.avif" alt="Writerzen App Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;">

Additionally, I obtained qualitative feedback from our internal customer success team to get more feedback/request features that we received from users on social media and the WriterZen community platform.

Below is the summary of the findings based on the metric:
<img src="/assets/writerzen-summaryfindings.avif" alt="Writerzen App Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;">

After obtaining all necessary data regarding the current performance of the website, me and customer success team created a ticket for the next working task, which we called Onboarding and Learning Hub version 2

<img src="/assets/writerzen-taskcard.avif" alt="Writerzen App Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;">

Technically, the toolset workflow is complicated and makes it hard for users to work effectively, resulting in low task success and adoption rate. Instead of finishing all steps, users often get stuck in the middle of the process and do not complete all the steps to see the final results.

> How to make the tool's workflow intuitive and easier for user to achieve desired outcomes?‍

According to the analysing result, I come to the conclusion that some steps could be followed to improve the product function:

Determining & focusing on a certain target user to get more actionable insights and find the effective solution to improve the task success and adoption rate.

Simplify the workflow or develop the supporting service to help users getting familiar with the tool

### Hypothesis

## Solution Steps

1. **Targeted user research** for actionable insights
2. **Simplified workflow** and developed supporting services
3. **Design sprint** with Customer Success & Business Analysis teams
4. **User adoption journey** mapped from awareness to learning

So that, With the joining of Customer Success & Business Analysis team, we had a design sprint to come up with a potential solution for the design concept

#### User adoption journey
Using the user adoption journey because I believe that it can help to ensure that the design aligns with the project goals & user needs.

The adoption journey shows the stages of users from awareness of the product to driving them to start using, from onboarding to the learning process. Regardless, I can create more effective design solutions that are likely to balance the user needs and company

## Prototype

With the wireframe, based on the available design system & guidelines, we developed the high-fidelity prototype. The learning hub function aims to resolve the pain points for beginning users who are confused by the complex workflow of the SEO toolset.

The detailed instructions for each feature and function can help the beginner get familiar with the tool. This feature also aims to increase the low adoption rate, so users can use the tool more effectively and improve the task output performance.

## Testing

Determining the criteria for usability & scorecard:
In this step, I utilise the scorecard, which is a useful tool in the testing phase of a UX design project after completing the prototype.

The scorecard is developed based on the project's requirements and objectives, and it can include various metrics such as ease of use, efficiency, user satisfaction, and accessibility. By using it, I can identify areas that need improvement and make informed decisions to refine the design before finalising it.

I firstly **conduct the internal usability testing** with the view to observing the efficiency of new functions.

<img src="/assets/writerzen-testing.avif" alt="Writerzen App Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;">

#### Interview transcripts
Based on the scorecard, I write the interview guide & transcript for the usability testing interview. The interview has three main sections: **pre-interview questions, practical tasks, and post-interview questions.**

There are a total of 3 features that have been tested with the new prototype, including the dashboard, the learning hub, and troubleshooting.

The *SUS questionnaire* was used in the late stage of the interview, after the post-text questions, so users could rate our website based on their points of view.

The testing result was displayed on the table and figure as below:

<img src="/assets/writerzen-testing-result-2.avif" alt="Writerzen App Screenshot" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;">

**Summary insights:**  
- Most users could complete tasks and rated the new function highly
- Some issues remain (33% shot issues), but expected to decline with further improvements

## Reflection

**Learning and next steps:**  
- In brief, my ability to interpret data has improved as a result of the project, and I now comprehend how to incorporate the data findings into user experience research to improve product performance.

- User research is crucial because it allows us to learn more about customers, their opinions, and how they interact with products. As a result, we can improve the quality of the products.

- Some design issues are more challenging to resolve and launching a product's new function requires detailed research from many perspectives.
