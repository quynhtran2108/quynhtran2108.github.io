# TravelBuddy – Future AI Assistance Mobile App for Public Transportation

**Year:** 2023  
**Client:** Solita  
**Collaboration:** Tampere University + Solita

**Purpose:**  
TravelBuddy is an innovative project to enhance the user experience of future transportation with AI assistance and accessibility features. The goal: find concrete solutions for public transportation in Finland and Europe.

## Problem

Many users face challenges with payment systems, schedules, and accessibility (e.g., carrying strollers on trams/trains). Price, easy ticketing, and navigation are also major concerns.

## My Role

I was working in a team of 5 other teammates, working closely with the stakeholder Solita. My responsibilities include user research, UX/UI design & pitching

## Outcome

### AI Assistance
#### AI personalise the daily trip and recommend place
TravelBuddy gives recommendations based on user preferences (affordable budget) and time availability on personal schedules. Chatbot is available for extra help and accessibility purposes.

### Accessibility
#### Freely modify accessibility and seating options
Accessibility options provide inclusivity to users with accessible needs and make sure that they have their requirements met while booking the tickets

### Navigation Instruction
#### Wearable device & safety
Sync the wearable device with the app and receive turn-by-turn directions without having to constantly check your phone

### Handling Privacy
#### Sensive matters 
Using transparent & just-in-time requests to build trust with our users and ensure that they are fully informed of what they are consenting to.

## Working Process

### Empathize

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Figure: Future wheel </em></p> 

During this phase, I focus on analysing some trends impacting passenger transportation in the next 10 years. By leveraging these trends. I recognise the need to stay open-minded about all ongoing trends to effectively tackle challenges and deliver valuable solutions to future users for this project. 

To have the big picture about what users want and think about future transportation. I conducted 2 pilot interviews & another 8 real interviews to gain more of their insights and feedback. I had thought about different user groups and who had experience with public transport and was the right fit for our user group.

##### Summary the user research:
In short, I found people usually have difficulty with *the payment system, checking and following the public transport schedule, and accessibility in carrying baby strollers* in the trams or trains.

Price is also a concern; when people expected to have an easy way to buy the cheap ticket options, difficulty in navigating the platform and trains was also a challenge for them.

### Define

Based on the summary, I create two user personas that represent the main target group:

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Figure: User Persona 1: Alex </em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Figure: User Persona 2: Jenni </em></p>

### Ideate
#### Brainstorming the most promising solution for future transportation:
Brainstorming session was the best ideation method that helped me find different solutions to the problems and issues raised by our users. Therefore, I spend time generating ideas that would take our concept toward success. 

After discussion within group members and the stakeholder, Solita, we ended up with the *AI assistant design concept.*


<img src="/assets/solita-ideate.avif" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Figure: AI Assistant concept </em></p>

Another method that I used to evaluate the design concept is the Value Proposition Canvas is made up of the view of customer profile and the value map. Based on the user persona, I put myself in users' shoes to understand what their *pain points (pains)* are, what they *want (gains)* and what they are supposed to *do (customer jobs)*.  Once I have a clear understanding of our users' needs, I can start outlining the product features that I can offer to adapt to the customer's pains & gains.

### User Flow & MVP

The MVP line includes all the touch points between the user and the product and any potential pain points or areas for improvement. 

Following that, the MVP line presents the significant features that can be included in the application, for example, the map visualisation, the cheap-price notification system, the automatic payment system, and holistic transportation guidelines. It connects with each other to create a concrete experience for the user.

### Storyboard & Testing

In order to further verify the potential of the product, I decided to develop the storyboard and test it with some recruiting participants. The questionnaire's goal was to get feedback from participants about the MVP, as well as walk them through the storyboard to gather suggestions and concerns.

#### Testing plan and results

### Prototyping

With the test findings, I start sketching the flowchart and the wireframe for the solution, an all-in-one mobile application generative-AI that makes people's daily trips easier and faster

## Reflection

**Learning:**  
I enjoyed working with my team the most, seeing the design project develop from scratch, and how our individual contributions came together to create a cohesive product. It was also great to dig into the different design principles, MVP, storyboards and methodologies I used throughout the project.

**Next Steps:**  

#### Further develop:

After gathering the user's feedback from the storyboard testing, there are some significant suggestions that I have not included yet and might develop more in the future, such as social features, wearable design and a price comparison system

#### Validate the product:

Due to the time limit, I don't have a chance to conduct the user testing to verify the high-fidelity prototype; therefore, in the future, I will conduct further testing to validate the product's usability, functionality, and overall user experience to achieve this goal. I will also prioritise addressing any issues during testing to ensure our product is ready for launch

#### Pitch with stakeholder:

In addition, my team and I meet with our client, Solita, to present current product design and ask for feedback and next plan. TravelBuddy has the potential to make an impact on the future of public transportation, and I hope it can reach as many people as possible
