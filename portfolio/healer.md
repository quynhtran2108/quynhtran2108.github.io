# Healer, mental healthcare app

**Role:** User research, site structure, wireframes and hi-fi prototypes.

**Motivation:**  
Many people nowadays, including me, suffer from difficulties in modern life and struggle with daily depression and unhealthy eating habits. The healer app is a place where users can track mood data, reduce sorrow, and keep fit.

## Design Process

### Empathize

#### User research

In the empathise process, I did some research to empathise and determine my target users. Accordingly, I conducted the quantitative methodology using the Google survey form. The survey has successfully obtained 52 responses. I did this survey to learn about users' situations and pain points. Therefore, it's easier to create a suitable product that adapts to their needs.

> **Research insights:**  
> Regardless of research insight, most of the respondents are male and are young workers. It demonstrates that the millennial generation is struggling with their daily emotions and stressful jobs.
 **â†’ Almost 90% prefer a mental healthcare app.**

### Define

#### Affinity diagram

When conducting the survey, I put open-ended questions to more deeply understand user problems.

I gathered all their answers and synthesised this data into the affinity diagram. The complete affinity diagram has been done by combining similar thoughts and ideas expressed during the interviews into four main groups.

These groupings were made by identifying themes in participant responses. Each theme represents the user's pain points that need to be taken into consideration in the design step.

#### User persona & journey map

Understanding users is a crucial part of the project because the final products are created based on their preferences and thinking. Focusing on their pain points, I created the user personas for the project.

### Prototype

#### From site structure to low-fidelity prototype

<img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61c5d8257767c120db6dc260/6245834cfa0f22408de56e5e_Untitled%20Diagram.drawio-2.png" alt="Site Structure" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;margin:2rem 0;">

According to the site structure, I sketched some wireframes to lay out content and functionality on the app that I am supposed to create. These wireframes were created based on user needs and user pain points.

Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content are added.

### Usability Testing

#### Testing scenarios

#### User feedback

Although it is preferable to do usability testing just after the low-fidelity prototype process, I choose to get it at the latter so that users may perceive the app with a high-fidelity visual design and some limitations can be improved in subsequent rounds.

Again, usability testing is compulsory after completing the design stage. Together with the test results, I can identify the strengths & weaknesses of the design.

## Reflection

### What I've learned ðŸŒž

When conducting the test among users, significant problems are that people themselves are not aware of the fundamental reasons that make them feel uncomfortable or confused when using an app. So, I've been concerned about observing the participants while following up on their stage of action. After all, I got a lot of valuable feedback, which could be used for my next product development step.

The entire process was indeed intense, and I learnt a lot. More importantly, it's exciting to receive various responses from different respondents while using the quantitative methodology, since each user has different pain areas and perspectives. Even so, it is feasible to develop solutions that benefit them and are valuable to me.

### Next step âœ¨

- The healer app has a couple of errors that need to be improved in the future. The alternative logo and branding design should be updated. Furthermore, keep testing and testing constantly in order to integrate and develop the design in the next rounds.

- Still, UX design is a long journey of working, studying and practising from time to time. I can't wait to continue with this path.
