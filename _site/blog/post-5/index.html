<h2>Virtual tourism is in demand.</h2>
<p>The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide is an incident that human beings have never thought of before. Lockdown, travel restriction, social distance are unprecedented things that we do not want to experience once more time in our life. Tourism, literally, is one of the most ravaging industries due to the pandemic impact. So this time is when virtual tourism is booming, even post-covid-19. In terms of tourism, one primary focus within the venture is virtual reality. Whether in hotels or tourist attractions such as museums or theme parks, VR has the prospects to provide customers with truly memorable experiences of life.</p>
<p>In a preceding survey conducted by Kerckhoffs Ltd. about how VR could improve their travel and tourism experiences. The survey aims to investigate people’s perceptions of immersive technologies concerning tourism. It discovered that more than half of respondents would be willing to pay for VR-based tourism if it was offered to them. Over 60% of respondents would like VR-based tourism to charge just under 5% of the average trip cost per person if they made a trip to the vacation spot.</p>

<h2>Responsibilities of VR/AR Designer</h2>
<p>Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create interactive experiences not constrained by the physical surroundings. A wearable headset takes over a user’s vision, blocking out their physical surroundings and immersing them in a completely virtual world. In other words, VR can make you feel as if you’re entering an enchanting imaginary land.</p>
<p>A VR/AR designer’s tasks and duties aim to resolve the method of creating a user experience that leverages 3D space, determine if this action causes a user motion sickness and ensure users are comfortable immersing themselves in a VR/AR experience. Thus, VR/AR designers must carefully consider everything from sound to lighting to create the most realistic feeling for users.</p>

<p>The development of conversation interfaces is explosive in intelligent virtual assistants like Siris, Google intending to adapt all the customers’ requirements through voice interaction. In contrast, virtual reality products can implement these conversational features and automobile navigation systems through voices and chatbots to enhance the user experiences. In this case, an AR/VR designer also plays a conservation designer, who incorporates natural, real-world conversational behaviours into the interactions between users and systems.</p>
<p>In other words, AR/VR designers leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user experiences that are intuitive and engaging. AR/VR designers should consider developing the user personas, flow and dialogue to ensure the most realistic experience of users. For example, a trip to a national park concludes not only the scenery but also the sound of nature, birds singing or even the whistles from other tourists, who are also participating in the trip. Thus, creating these feelings and interactions for users who tend to participate in a virtual tour could be considered.</p>

<h2>Future opportunities</h2>
<p>Before the disease outbreak, the use of such virtual tours was still being researched and tested by tourist destinations and tour operators. The technology was still primarily seen as a marketing tool for a physical site. However, when the Covid-19 are still haunting, many countries avoid overcrowded places and impose travel restrictions. Virtual tourism could be considered as the alternative way for travelling at home.</p>
<p>In reality, the over-consumption of tourism has resulted in tolls, tourist quotas, or even morning draws for a day visit. Therefore the virtual tour provides a coherent and ethically beneficial option. It is also a tool for democratization of knowledge and learning, providing access to world-famous locations while using minimal resources.</p>
<p>Linking VR to tourism, some people might see VR as a tool to visit hotels, destinations or attractions before physically travelling to a specific location. Although this is an option and might be useful in the planning process of a vacation, VR can also be much more than that. Various online travel agencies (OTA) started their first virtual tours amid the covid-19, and this trend could, even more, expand post-covid-19. As a matter of fact, there are huge opportunities for AR/VR designers in the virtual tourism sector. To cope with the virtual products, AR/VR designers answer questions, including</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s the ideal images and flow based on who users are?</li>
<li>How is the task to be accomplished? Will the user, get fun and excitement?</li>
<li>In the context of the virtual tour, does the authenticity of the virtual tour seems engaging and reflective with on-screen elements?</li>
<li>Does the VR/AR design offer a consistent, usable, and useful experience end-to-end?</li>
</ul>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the great transformation in the tourism market recently, the advanced modification of tourism processes and models is required to adapt to the user demand. VR/AR design is a rapidly changing field with an incredible growth rate in the last few years, thanks to the development of technology and AI.</p>
<p>In fact, traditional tourism will never be replaced by virtual tourism. However, virtual tourism can be an accomplice for traditional tourism, especially in the post-covid-19 era when the tourism sector requires revitalisation. VR/AR designers, by the way, need to take advantage to meet the expected growth. As a result, the huge impact of emerging VR/AR technology is anticipated in the years ahead.</p>
