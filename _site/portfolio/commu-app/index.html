<h1>Commu – Research Mentorship Growth Service for Social Sustainability Platform</h1>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2023<br>
<strong>Client:</strong> Commu<br>
<strong>Collaboration:</strong> Commu App &amp; HUBS</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Commu is a mobile application connecting regional companies, NGOs, and individuals to enhance social sustainability. The current version includes a pop-up map for individuals, suggesting ways to collaborate. This project is a collaboration between the start-up Commu App and HUBS.</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>There was no existing mentoring system. Commu wanted to develop a customer-centric mentoring platform to address diverse needs.</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>My Role</h2>
<ul>
<li>Participated in all project stages in cluding: Worked with stakeholders, conducted user &amp; market research and finally. created wireframes</li>
</ul>
<img src="/assets/commu-teams.avif" alt="commu-screenshot" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p><strong>Team members:</strong> Quynh, Ibtehaz, Anni, Mia, Max</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed the mentorship concept and platform structure</li>
<li>See the full wireframe here: <a href="#">Wireframe Link</a> <!-- Add your wireframe link if available --></li>
</ul>
<h3>Working process</h3>

<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Empathise</h2>
<p>We are living in the fast-paced era: Where we can see clearly the changing of the world day-by-day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How the mentorship program can be designed to adapt with the fast-paced era and help to create the sustainable community for mentor-mentee?</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="/assets/commu-future-wheel.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p>To started, I determine the success metric for the project:</p>
<img src="/assets/commu-success-metric.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p>Studying and analysing the external environment helps to understand the environmental influences on an entity and guides me in strategic decision-making for the mentorship concept.</p>

<h3>Business Perspective Challenges</h3>
<p>Commu doesn't have an existing mentoring system. They want to have the develop a Customer-centric mentoring platform to address diverse needs,</p>
<h4>Competitor analysis:</h4>
<p>I started the market analysis with research about competitors. With insights provided by the stakeholder, Commu app, I analyse the competitor &amp; identify the gaps and opportunities for improvement. There are two competitors that I examined, namely Prönö &amp; ADP List. The findings are as follows:</p>
<img src="/assets/commu-competitor-analysis.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<h3>Customer Perspective</h3>
<p>To better understand the user's need about the platform, I conduct the interview &amp; questionnaire survey</p>
<h4>Survey results:</h4>
<p>The surveys were sent to former mentees and mentors, specifically targetingindividuals known to the team members. As a result, we received responses fromthree mentees and three mentors. The answers provided in the survey haveprovided us with valuable insights and identified common problems in the currentmentoring systems. By analyzing these answers, we aim to develop solutions to address these issues</p>
<img src="/assets/commu-survey-results.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p><strong>Key finding:</strong><br>
Long-term and short-term unemployed individuals are the main target group, with a need for initial guidance and structured support.</p>
<p>I chose this group based on their specific needs, the absence of competitors in this area, and the importance of social sustainability. The survey results revealed a common ground among these individuals, highlighting the need for an organised and structured mentoring platform that emphasises personal connections between mentors and mentees. Additionally, the survey indicated that initial assistance or guidance provided at the start of the mentoring relationship was highly valued based on positive experiences</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion...</strong>
The survey has provided me with a solid framework to delve into the specific needs of our customers and assess the significance of certain core values that our platform must uphold.</p>

<h2>Define</h2>
<p>The current mentoring system contains the roots of problems</p>
<p>To get started, I use problem tree analysis to identify key root problems related to effectively connecting mentors and mentees. The problem summary is shown in the figure below.</p>
<img src="/assets/commu-define-howtoconnect.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<p>From the stakeholder aspect,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This analysis highlights the varying degrees of influence and the importance of catering to the individual's requirements within the mentoring platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stakeholder analysis encompasses multiple entities, including the public, private sector, and individuals. Each stakeholder group has a distinct influence on Commu and its platform, and I analysed what each stakeholder receives from Commu.</p>

<h3>Mentorship Concept</h3>
<p>The mentorship process <em>starts when people have the purpose and motivation to learn and desire succeed and finishes when the mentee has successfully achieved their goals with the help of the mentor</em></p>
<img src="/assets/commu-mentorship-concept.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<h3>Mentoring as a system</h3>
<p>Mentoring can manifest in different forms; several successful models exist, such as formal mentoring that sets specific goals, formless mentoring that focuses on time-specific topics, and peer mentoring where there is no hierarchy between mentors and mentees, enabling inspiration and specific support. According to that, I developed the parameter models that can contribute to successful mentoring in general.</p>

<h2>Ideate</h2>
<p>Meet the potential user, Mr Ville</p>

<h3>Come up with the initial MVP:</h3>
<p>An important note is to ensure that the platform does not overwhelm users. so that, minimizing excessive information requirements and streamlining the user experience to provide a seamless and user-friendly platform.</p>

<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Before creating the wireframe, it is important to think about the logic of the mentoring system. In the initial meeting with Commu, the organisations with mentoring programs were presented, each sharing a common theme. These organisations have various tasks, including receiving applications, manually reviewing them, matching mentors with mentees, and tracking mentees' progress.</p>
<p>Platform-based system structure has been chosen, where Commu will develop the mentoring platform.</p>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the entire design, including the presence of each stakeholder.</p>
<img src="/assets/COMMU-DESIGN-DIAGRAM.avif" alt="data raw" style="width:100%; display:block; margin:auto;" />
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>Conclusion &amp; Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to time constraints, I cannot conduct the comprehensive testing to verify the wireframe and mentorship concept. However, as the project scope is not limited to platform design but rather service design and product development, I've received sessions from the facilitator on marketing and made a deliberate choice not to prioritise it extensively within the design of the mentor-mentee platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead, I allocated time towards strengthening the current findings and incorporating some marketing schemes into the persona profiles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
