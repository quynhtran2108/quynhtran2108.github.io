## What does the Storyboard mean?

It is a series of panels that visually describe or explore a user’s experience with a product. While the user journey is also used to map the users’ stories, the storyboard provides an overview of their expertise in interacting with the product through different pain points.

## Here are some tips for you!

### Think about the solution for the user’s pain points

Storyboarding is separated into frames because it is a technique for visualising potential solutions the user is experiencing. There are four critical elements of a storyboard, including character, scene, plot and narrative. To figure out the pain points of the character as the user in the story, a designer should image the users’ scene to describe the design’s benefit or solution, which is the plot. Finally, the narrative describes the user’s need or problem and how the design will solve the problem.

The scenario of storyboarding should be short that helps understand the user and the problem we’re solving. By detailing how the user interacts with the product, the captions integrate the visuals and context. It’s essentially the prose that describes each scene in the story.

### Sketching the storyboard based on the user journey map

Regardless of Sarah Ribbons, a journey map visual represents a person’s steps to accomplish a goal. Journey mapping begins by compiling a series of user actions into a timeline in its most basic form. To create a narrative, the timeline is then fleshed out with user thoughts and emotions. Therefore, the storyboard that sketching based on the journey map.

For example, Teija is a teacher who wants to grab a cup of coffee in a hurry and set the table seat beforehand because she is always in a rush and has a tight schedule for a lunch break. In the first frame, Teija is frustrated at the coffee store because the queue is so long, and she is primarily late from work. In the second frame, the staff introduces a new platform, which helps customers and staff members to save time. Teija and other customers look surprised, but they all seem interested in the new app. The next frame seems most customers use the new app instead of waiting in a long line. Besides ordering the food & drink, the app also lets users choose their exciting corner. They found the app extremely handy in the last frame that they don’t need to wait in queue anymore.

So, that is a sample of the storyboarding that nails the user’s problem statements and turns them into goal statements based on the user journey. These pain points turn into happy points, and users’ problems can be solved.

### Don’t forget the close-up storyboarding. It is not essential but helpful.

Meanwhile, storyboarding depicts the emotional engagement that a user will have with products. The close-up storyboarding seems less emotional engagements but more detail about the practicalities of the design itself. In other words, a close-up storyboard focuses on the product instead of on the user experience.

If you’re still at an early design project stage, you might want to present your high-level concepts to stakeholders to get them excited and onboard. As a UX designer, it’s ideal to bring both storyboards together to have a flexible and creative approach to explaining your ideas. Additionally, the close-up storyboard is more beneficial after you’ve explored your initial design guidance. Thus, it seems unnecessary but very helpful because later on, close-up storyboard sketching could be utilised to draw the digital wireframes.

## Conclusion

Using storyboards to sketch an idea allows you to work through the experience’s flow. It can also serve as visual guidance in explaining your concepts to stakeholders, as they could see how the product you’re designing will be used. However, it is sometimes challenging when your sketching and your imagination doesn’t match. An actual product may have several displays, but the storyboard could focus only on the essential aspects of the user’s experience, as the name implies. Thus, that story can tell through the panels of a storyboard.
