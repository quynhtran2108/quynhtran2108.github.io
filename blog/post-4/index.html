<p>Imposter syndrome is very common among designers, particularly those who are new to the field. There are tons of things to learn, while you have no idea where to start or cope with multiple works and clients. It leaves you feeling insecure from the inside. Impostor syndrome can manifest itself in a variety of ways in the workplace. For instance, you feel that you’re not enough for the task and never fulfil the expectation unless you meet all of the requirements, take on extra work to ensure you’re completing everything, and dismiss praise. Design is a harsh process, and it takes a long-term to fulfil your skills. Thus, it’s normal to be apprehensive at first. Impostor syndrome is one of the challenges we all encounter as we advance in our careers. Everyone, from the junior, senior to executives, might feel like an impostor at times. There are a variety of reasons why we may experience imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>Impostor syndrome is the internal perception that, despite your achievement, you believe that you’re inexperienced, inferior to others, or bad at your profession. Therefore, you may feel insecure from time to time. The concept of impostor syndrome is most often attributed to intelligence and success, it also has connections to perfectionism and social setting.</p>
<p>It is easy to connect with people worldwide nowadays, and you frequently match someone who also has the same situation as you. Each person’s version of impostor syndrome is unique. There are, nevertheless, certain clear signs to be considered.</p>

<h2>How to overcome the imposter syndrome?</h2>
<p>Knowledge is unlimited. The more knowledge you secure yourself, the more confident you feel. Acknowledge your thoughts is very important, and it helps to fill the gap of things you lack. No one understands you rather than yourself, so recognize how you’re feeling and think about your own patterns to identify the situation that makes you feel impostor syndrome and avoid it.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is important to recognize that you are all responsible for your achievements. Your achievement is not the result of good fortune or the assistance of others, but your intelligence and hard effort. It is not denied that humility is essential for your career path, but accepting responsibility for your contribution to success is even more essential to enhance your confidence.</p>
<p>Thirdly, make a list of things that demonstrate your qualifications for the position you’re pursuing. Otherwise, make a list of achievements you’re proud of and concentrate on all of the distinct skills you have to offer. It could be helpful to strike up a dialogue and talk to your colleagues, mentors or even your friends about what’s going on in your head can help you deal with your inner critic.</p>
<p>Fourthly, as I mentioned before, you’re not alone. Thousands of people are learning about UX design every day, and they’re as same as you, that all supposed to feel like an impostor in the new area. No matter the reason, you are not the only one. So, simply having a conservation with your co-workers, mentors and even your competitors. Many people literally are unwilling to express their feelings because they are afraid of how others will react. However, people are not as mean as you thought, and you’re never an outsider when you are officially in a team or a group. So, release the stress and try to reconnect with others, particularly when changing jobs or taking on new duties at work.</p>
<p>Finally, taking the extra design course on the internet is also a beneficial method. There are tons of sources to study UX design, such as Coursera, Udemy, Interaction Design Foundation. Once you find out which part of UX design inspired you, from a UX researcher, UX designer, UX writer, to a UX developer, you can pick one of them to develop and inquiry the skill. When you demonstrate that you have curiosity, perseverance, and tenacity and show that you desire to learn, you can succeed.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Even a newbie or an expert with decades of experience, UX designers might feel like frauds at times. However, over time, you can identify the design skills that have helped you gain confidence in yourself. I’ve also discovered that recognizing your accomplishments, making a list of your advantages and starting a conversation will help you overcome thoughts of impostor syndrome. Starting a new job or changing fields takes time. If you find yourself doubting your abilities, remember that everyone started somewhere and consider whether you’re suffering from imposter syndrome. You can allow yourself a break and accept that you will make mistakes along the path.</p>
