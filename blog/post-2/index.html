        <h1>Full master scholarship in HCI with an unrelated bachelor’s degree: My 5 steps</h1>
<p><em>Quynh Tran · 5 min read · Apr 12, 2022</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been admitted for the Master of Computing Science, Human-Technology Interaction with the 100% tuition-fee scholarship from Tampere University, Finland without the relevant bachelor’s. This was a long journey since I learned about user experience design. This article will reveal some of my tips on how I can nail it.</p>

<p><strong>About the university:</strong><br>
Tampere University is the third largest and one of the most multidisciplinary universities in Finland. The university placed 34th and the top 250–300th world university in the recently announced Times Higher Education Young University Rankings for 2022.</p>
<p><strong>The university ranking facts:</strong><br>
<a href="/assets/blog-6,2.webp">Resources: Times Higher Education</a></p>
<p>To get to know about my background, I graduated from a Finnish university of applied sciences with a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management. At the time I applied for the master’s degree, I didn’t have any prior work experience in user experience design or a related bachelor’s degree. But, in some way, I attempted to connect my background to the human-computer interaction field as much as feasible and demonstrate my knowledge in HCI. These are 5 steps that I have done to prepare for my application to the HCI master’s degree.</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>1. Take some online courses to fill the knowledge gap in the HCI field</h2>
<p>The actual reason that most master’s degrees require a relevant bachelor’s degree is because nobody wants to admit a student who has no idea what they will study at the master level. They want to make sure that their students comprehend the material and are able to witness the field. Without a solid basis, it is impossible to learn something at a high level. Therefore, you should demonstrate that you have the potential to study for a master’s degree without the relevant background. In order to do that, you can take some online courses to prove your knowledge in the field.</p>
<p>As you have seen, there are thousands of user experience courses available to you for a very little cost. To mention a few, I can recommend the Google UX Professional Design, The Interaction Design Foundation and a variety of other intriguing courses offered on Coursera, Udemy… Taking some foundation courses in interaction design could broaden your understanding of what this field entails, and the examiner will notice that you’re concentrating on the HCI field. It also showed that you have some prior knowledge of the subject you’ll be studying in the future. So, as a first step, remember to brush up on your knowledge of what you’ll be doing.</p>

<h2>2. Create your own story about why you transition from your current field to HCI</h2>
<p>There might be thousands of reasons you transition from your current background to HCI. In my own story, I had a chance to participate in a design hackathon in the third year at university. My team got the first award with the solution for the case company challenge. We created a responsive UI application to assist users using solar energy corporately. At that time, I developed a passion for the way we make something meaningful to users and enterprises with technology. In my motivation, I mentioned how I found a connection between the creativity of digital service design and the logic of computer tech in the HCI program. Also, I spoke about my passion for bringing lifelong values to people. I want to study in a program where I can integrate human psychology into technological products and use my knowledge in the hospitality field to understand users.</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>3. Capture a few relevant points between your previous degree (or experience) and HCI</h2>
<p>In fact, all fields are relevant in some way and it is your job to point out how they might be connected. For example, in my case, I have a bachelor in Hospitality Management, where I had a chance to study service experience design and customer psychology. In my motivation letter, I emphasized my minor study in tourism service design, where I learned about how to empathize and understand customers to create a memorable experience for them. Also, my thesis focused on psychology and behavior, investigating wellness, travel motivation, and decisions post COVID-19 when I had a chance to research human psychology.</p>
<p>As a result, strive to record as many significant points between your background and the HCI field as feasible. If your background is in marketing, explain how you got to know about digital service through the marketing field. You can absolutely research the connection between your subject and HCI; these should be valuable resources that you can utilize in your motivation letter.</p>

<h2>4. Polish your portfolio even if it is not required</h2>
<p>It is not stated in the master’s requirement that I must show them my portfolio. To demonstrate, only a suitable bachelor’s degree is required. Because I lacked the necessary bachelor’s degree, my portfolio served as a showcase and a transcript to demonstrate my ability to learn in the field of user experience design. I created three case studies: one for developing an app, one for re-designing, and one for my winning design hackathon solution. One useful advice for the re-design application is to try to re-design the university’s website that you’re applying to for your project. For me, I re-designed SISU, a Tampere University student utility. I’m guessing it’ll be a significant bonus for me. Indeed, nothing is better than the future student trying to enhance the user experience for their future university, is it?</p>
<hr class="section-divider">
<h2>5. Show them you’re ready to start the new journey</h2>
<p>You’ve demonstrated certain abilities, goals, and a personal story that brought you to this field. Now is the time for you to shine. You must genuinely appreciate working in UX design, and you thrive on the opportunity to delve deeper into this field, as seen by the fact that examiners can see your enthusiasm and interest for the industry. You also need to be aware of your skills and personality qualities that could help you become a good UX designer in the future, and you’re ready to embark on your new career path.</p>
<p>The most important thing to remember is to be yourself. You can’t impress someone with someone else’s tale; you can only wow them with your own story, your own style, and that makes you stand out among thousands of other candidates. Make an impression on them with your story, your profile, and your experiences, and you may be able to get accepted to your desired university without many prior experience years.</p>
