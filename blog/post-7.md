<h1>No need to spend 3 years to squircle your logo. Figma can help in 1 minute.</h1>

> According to Shen, it is reported from Xiaomi representer that the company has spent around $300,000 redesigning their new brand logo in 3 years. The designer, Hara, describes the new logo as the result of “the power of mathematics” to find the perfect middle ground between a square and a circle. Despite the meaningful storytelling behind, if you just need to squircle your logo freely in your own style, this is the article for you.

You can drag and drop images directly into the canvas, as with many other photo editing programs. When you click on the image, the right-hand tool column will appear, with three main tabs: Design, Prototype, and Inspect. To squircle the logo, you can press the Design tab.

An Independent corners button can be found in the Design tab. Click here to edit each corner of the photo, then proceed to rounding it to suit your personal preferences. When you click on “Independent corners”, a new line will appear with four default values of “0”, representing the four image corners that have not been fixed yet.

With each individual curvature index, you can edit these to the desired values to round the desired image corners. From left to right, four indicators represent four corners; the first index represents the upper left corner, and the residual indices represent the remaining corners following clockwise.

Finally, to entering a new value to indicate the desired amount of curvature, you can smooth the newly created curves by pressing the “…” button next to the indicators.

This is just a fun tip that I was inspired by the article from Daniel Pepper about the new logo of Xiaomi. By the way, it could be familiar with most advanced Designers, but will be helpful for the beginners who are on track to learn about Figma and who just want to redesign their logo in another interesting way.
