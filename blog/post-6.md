# The 5Ws you should ask when starting participating observation for design project

*Quynh Tran · 5 min read · Sep 06, 2021*

>The very first step of user experience design is always a harsh process and takes a long time. Depending on the project's purpose and how it could be processed, participant observation could be implemented for each project. Here are the 5Ws you need to take into account beforehand if you want to know about participant observation in user experience and what you should carry out among users.

## WHY

A great starting point of designing new technology is to properly articulate an existing problem and identify the users’ needs. Finding a large problem or need frequently leads to an untapped opportunity for design. At the same time, observing users can also help develop empathy and think from users’ perspectives as if you were walking in someone else’s shoes. Therefore, if you want to understand more about your target customers, participant observation can be used in evaluation to retrieve benchmark and descriptive data during project implementation. Its results could be considered documents for design activities, processes, and outcomes.

## WHEN

You started thinking and planning for participant observation but don’t know when to start. Let’s consider if:

- You’re seeking direct information: Imagine that you need to improve the customer experience performance for a large-scale business in the short term. Paying a visit to a store, observing business operations and procedures can gain more information than relying on reports or key informants.
- You’re trying to understand ongoing behavior: In some cases, your target customer will not answer as they thought, and the best solution you can do is observe their behavior, figuring out how they interact in particular circumstances.
- Physical evidence products can be readily seen: When it is required to inspect a location (museum, garden, stadium…), project books or newsletters, observation is the best method.
- You’re thinking written issues and other data collection procedures seem inappropriate: Instead of having all participants respond to a questionnaire form, you only need a group of volunteers to observe and report the result.

## WHO

- **Yourself:** You have the greatest probability of being the observer. Prepare an observation guide, a checklist, or a notebook to record your observations and comments for specific cases.
- **Participant:** Whether chosen at random and asked to do some particular observing or a steering panel purposefully selected, participants are in a good position to observe a program. You could focus on the things to look for, either individually or as a group, decide to record anything considered essential. During a debriefing, observers can share their observations and discuss the implications of what they saw.
- **Stakeholder:** If key stakeholders are “available”, involving them as an authorized observer can serve as a promotional effort, raise the executive’s awareness of the project’s depth and value, and provide you with evaluative data.
- **Colleague:** The observations of other agents, specialists, and collaborators could be beneficial to your project. You might be able to create a mutually beneficial relationship. Other team members could provide this input and feedback while interfering minimally. In fact, using a team to collect observation data provides a complete picture and helps avoid individual biases in data collection and analysis.

## WHAT

The possibilities for observation are almost limitless, including people, behaviors, reactions, physical settings, environmental features, record-keeping systems, project reports, and more. In addition, there are some questions that you might ask when observing:

- What do people do?
- What values and goals do they have?
- How are these particular activities embedded in a large ecology of artefacts and social networks?
- What are the similarities and differences across people?
- Do everyone in a particular community do the same thing, or are there some more idiosyncratic things?

On the other hand, it is impossible to observe all people, websites, or program documents. Thus, it would help if you sampled these cases.

## HOW

Observations are recorded to be useful and credible for project evaluation. This can also be done on the spot, but it is also possible to record your observations after leaving the situation. It is critical to document the date and location of the observation. It is beneficial to provide a brief description of the context in which the observation occurred. There are examples of three observation forms:

- **Observation guides:**

## CONCLUSION

When surveying users, major problems are that people themselves are not aware of their real reasons for motivating them. It is simply to point out that if you ask people what they want instead of observing what they do, you can easily be led astray. So, what you need to concern about is how to ask and listen to figure out what people’s real goals are. At this point, participant observation is better than simply convening a focus group to unearth real behaviors and needs.
